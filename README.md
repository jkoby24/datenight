# datenight

This is a homework assignment for Case Western Reserve University Coding Bootcamp. This is our first group project in class and the purpose is to work in groups of 4-5 people and build a website using certain criteria. 

Our website is called Date Night and the purpose of our site is for a couple, who is stuck at home, to find a new movie to watch and a new recipe to make and have a date night at home.
